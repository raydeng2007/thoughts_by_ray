# Hey, I'm Ray :) 

Quick little intro about me: I'm a software developer, basketball fan, cat lover, travelling enthusiast, a not-very-good gamer but a somewhat decent cook. I also have a 
great interest in all things astrophysics, even though I most likely won't understand most of the words in a quantum mechanics academic paper, I can
 listen to [Sean Carroll's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll) podcast and understand enough of it to be entertained.

# So, what's this blog about? 

That's a great question that, ironically, I'm asking myself too at the moment I'm writing this post. 
There was a previous version of this blog that I made during my time in University, as a student with 
little experience trying to find an internship in the software world, the reason I made 
that blog was simple, to make something that looked decent enough to convince potential employers that
I have some passable Side Projectsâ„¢. 

As all things that are forced, it did not turn out very well. In fact I don't think I spent more 
than a weekend on building the blog and even less time to think about things to post on it. 
I made a corny 'hello world' post and a crappy 'tutorial' post before that blog was never touched 
again. 

I built this blog during the great plague of 2020 when I had a little too much time on my hands 
and a little too many things on my mind. Seems like a perfect combo for a blog if you ask me. Except 
this time I actually wanted to make one, the way I wanted to make it.

So far, there's ability to 
 
* share and copy code blocks with syntax highlighting. I think this will be really useful for when I share 
my journey on learning new tech stacks or ML libraries.

* toggle between light and dark mode for both content and code blocks. 
```python
print("hello world 2.0")
```


I want to add features such as a tagging system, a comment section and *maybe* a newsletter in the 
very near future.

I also don't want this to be another typical programmer blog where every post is related to 
programming. I envisioned this blog
to be a somewhat representation of me and all my interests, I want to be able to talk about 
basketball, movies I enjoyed, music I listened to and maybe even how I view my life and what I think 
it's about. 

# Anyways

I'm glad to have this place to share my thoughts and excited to see this blog grow :)
