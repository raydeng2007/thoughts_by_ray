## Hey, I'm Ray :) 

A little intro about myself and some of my interests, I'm a: 
* Software developer
* Basketball fan
* Animal lover 
* Travelling enthusiast
* Not-very-good gamer 
* Somewhat decent cook

I'm also fascinated by anything astronomy related. Even though I might not have a strong grasp of some of the complex concepts, I still enjoy following the latest developments
surrounding it and occasionally looking up at the night sky to appreciate its vastness.

## So, what's this blog gonna be about? 

Well to be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure.

There was a previous version of this blog that I made during my time in University, as a student with 
little experience trying to find an internship in the software world, the reason I made 
that blog was simple, to make something that looked decent enough to convince potential employers that
I have some passable Side Projectsâ„¢. 

Like all things that are forced, it didn't turn out well. In fact, I don't think I spent more 
than a weekend on building the blog and probably even less time thinking about things to post on it. 
I made a corny 'hello world' post (similar to this one) and a crappy 'tutorial' post before that blog was never touched 
again. 

I built this blog during the great plague of 2020 when I had a little too much time on my hands 
and a little too many things on my mind. It seemed like a perfect time for me to start a blog. Except 
this time I actually wanted to make one, the way I wanted to make it.

I don't really want this to be another typical programmer blog where every post is related to programming. 

I hoped for this blog
to be a somewhat representation of me and all my interests, I want to be able to talk about 
basketball, movies I enjoyed, music I listened to and maybe even how I view my life and what I think 
it's about. 

## How I built this blog

The blog is built with Gatsby + GraphQL,
So far, there's ability to 
 
* share and copy code blocks with syntax highlighting. I think this will be really useful for when I share 
my journey on learning new tech stacks or ML libraries.

* toggle between light and dark mode for both content and code blocks. 
```python
print("hello world 2.0")
```

I want to add features such as a tagging system, a comment section and *maybe* a newsletter in the 
very near future.

## Anyways

I'm glad to have this place to share my thoughts, even if there's not many readers, I think this 
blog would be like a nice little journal to look back at after several years, cheers :)
